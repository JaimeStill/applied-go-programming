## AECS Framework

This Path implements the **Agentic Exercise Curriculum System** (AECS), a methodology for mastering technical subjects through Exercise-driven learning rather than passive consumption.

**Core AECS Principles**:
- **Exercise Primacy**: Every learning interaction centers on building working code, never passive reading
- **Concept Atomicity**: Each Exercise demonstrates exactly one Go concept in its simplest useful form
- **Applied Understanding**: Learning occurs through practical implementation producing tangible results
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each concept builds incrementally on previously mastered dependencies

**Framework Structure**: The complete AECS methodology and reusable templates are contained in `_framework/` for creating similar Exercise-driven learning experiences in other technical domains.
