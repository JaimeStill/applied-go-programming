# Applied Go Programming

A comprehensive Go programming Path built with the Agentic Exercise Curriculum System (AECS) that transforms experienced developers into Go masters through intensive, hands-on Exercises rather than passive learning.

## What You'll Build

Through this Exercise-driven Path, you'll develop expertise by building real applications that demonstrate Go's unique approach to concurrent programming, systems development, and production-ready software. Every concept is mastered through practical implementation that produces working, testable code.

**Learning Through Building**: 11 progressive Stages containing atomic Exercises that take you from Go fundamentals to production systems, each requiring immediate hands-on implementation rather than theoretical study.

**Production Portfolio**: Complete the Path with working applications including concurrent web services, data processing pipelines, microservices architectures, cloud-native deployments, and comprehensive monitoring systems.

## Stage Progression

This Path progresses through 11 Stages, each building practical mastery through atomic Exercises:

**Foundation Stages**:
- **Stage 1: Fundamentals** - Core Go constructs through working programs
- **Stage 2: Concurrency** - Goroutines and channels through concurrent applications
- **Stage 3: Data Structures** - Efficient algorithms with benchmark validation

**Application Stages**:
- **Stage 4: Advanced Features** - Sophisticated language constructs through real implementations
- **Stage 5: Architecture** - Maintainable applications using proven patterns
- **Stage 6: Testing** - Comprehensive test suites with coverage analysis
- **Stage 7: Network Programming** - Distributed systems from protocols to services

**Production Stages**:
- **Stage 8: Database Integration** - Robust data persistence with performance optimization
- **Stage 9: Cloud-Native** - Container orchestration and Kubernetes deployment
- **Stage 10: Performance** - Profiling and optimization for production workloads
- **Stage 11: Operations** - Complete observability and production readiness

Each Stage contains focused Exercises that build working applications demonstrating specific Go concepts in practical contexts.

## Prerequisites

**Programming Experience**: Proficiency in at least one language (Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, etc.) with understanding of fundamental concepts through hands-on implementation.

**Technical Setup**: Go 1.24+, code editor with Go support, Docker for deployment exercises, and basic command-line familiarity.

**Learning Commitment**: 12-16 weeks self-paced with focus on building working applications rather than consuming theoretical content.

## Getting Started

1. **Review the Complete Path**: Examine `PATH.md` for the full 11-Stage progression and expected outcomes
2. **Start Building Immediately**: Begin with `stages/01-fundamentals/stage.md` and complete each Exercise by building working Go code
3. **Progress Through Dependencies**: Each Stage builds on previously mastered concepts - complete Stages sequentially
4. **Validate Through Implementation**: Every Exercise must produce working code that compiles, runs, and demonstrates the target concept

**Exercise Structure**: Each Exercise follows AECS methodology with single-concept focus, immediate hands-on building requirements, and tangible implementation outcomes.

## AECS Framework

This Path implements the **Agentic Exercise Curriculum System** (AECS), a methodology for mastering technical subjects through Exercise-driven learning rather than passive consumption.

**Core AECS Principles**:
- **Exercise Primacy**: Every learning interaction centers on building working code, never passive reading
- **Concept Atomicity**: Each Exercise demonstrates exactly one Go concept in its simplest useful form
- **Applied Understanding**: Learning occurs through practical implementation producing tangible results
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each concept builds incrementally on previously mastered dependencies

**Framework Structure**: The complete AECS methodology and reusable templates are contained in `_framework/` for creating similar Exercise-driven learning experiences in other technical domains.
