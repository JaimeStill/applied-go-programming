# Basic Goroutines and Concurrent Execution: Your First Steps into Go Concurrency

## Exercise Metadata

- **Chapter**: Chapter 1: Concurrency and Parallelism
- **Exercise Number**: Exercise 1
- **Difficulty**: Beginner
- **Estimated Time**: 45-60 minutes
- **Concepts**: goroutines, go keyword, concurrent execution, non-deterministic ordering, main function coordination
- **Prerequisites**: basic Go syntax, functions, understanding of sequential vs concurrent execution

## Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will be able to:

- [ ] Create and launch goroutines using the `go` keyword
- [ ] Understand the difference between concurrent and sequential execution
- [ ] Recognize and handle non-deterministic behavior in concurrent programs
- [ ] Coordinate goroutines with the main function using basic synchronization
- [ ] Identify common pitfalls in basic goroutine usage
- [ ] Apply goroutines to solve simple concurrent processing problems

## Overview

This exercise introduces you to goroutines, Go's fundamental concurrency primitive. You'll learn how to create lightweight threads that run concurrently with your main program, understand why concurrent execution produces non-deterministic results, and practice basic coordination techniques.

### Why This Matters

Goroutines are what make Go exceptionally powerful for building concurrent systems. From web servers handling thousands of simultaneous requests to data processing pipelines working on multiple tasks at once, goroutines are the foundation of scalable Go applications. Understanding how to create and coordinate goroutines is essential for any Go developer working on real-world systems.

### What You'll Build

You'll build a series of programs that demonstrate concurrent execution patterns, starting with simple goroutine creation and progressing to coordinated task processing. Each part builds upon the previous one, culminating in a production-ready concurrent task processor.

## Code Examples

### Basic Pattern

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

// Basic goroutine creation with proper synchronization
func main() {
    // This runs in the main goroutine
    fmt.Println("Main: Starting program")
    
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(1)
    
    // Launch a new goroutine
    go func() {
        defer wg.Done()
        fmt.Println("Goroutine: Hello from goroutine!")
    }()
    
    // Wait for the goroutine to complete
    wg.Wait()
    fmt.Println("Main: Program ending")
}
```

### Key Concepts Explained

The `go` keyword creates a new goroutine - a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime. When you prefix a function call with `go`, that function executes concurrently with the rest of your program. The key points:

1. **Lightweight**: Goroutines have tiny stack sizes (2KB initially) and can create thousands easily
2. **Concurrent**: Multiple goroutines can run simultaneously
3. **Non-blocking**: The `go` statement doesn't wait for the goroutine to complete
4. **Scheduled**: The Go runtime automatically schedules goroutines across available CPU cores
5. **Proper Synchronization**: Use `sync.WaitGroup` or channels instead of `time.Sleep()` for coordination - this ensures goroutines complete reliably regardless of timing

### Advanced Implementation

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

func processTask(taskID int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done() // Mark this goroutine as done when function exits
    
    // Simulate work
    duration := time.Duration(taskID*100) * time.Millisecond
    time.Sleep(duration)
    
    fmt.Printf("Task %d completed after %v\n", taskID, duration)
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    
    // Launch multiple goroutines
    for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
        wg.Add(1) // Increment the counter
        go processTask(i, &wg)
    }
    
    fmt.Println("All tasks started, waiting for completion...")
    wg.Wait() // Block until all goroutines call Done()
    fmt.Println("All tasks completed!")
}
```

## Understanding the Concept

### Mental Model

Think of goroutines like having multiple assistants working on different tasks simultaneously. Your main program is like a manager who can delegate work to these assistants. Once you give an assistant a task (launch a goroutine), they work independently while you continue with other activities.

The key insight: **concurrent doesn't mean simultaneous**. Even on a single CPU core, goroutines take turns executing so quickly that they appear to run at the same time. On multi-core systems, they can truly run simultaneously.

### How to Think About It

1. **Creation is cheap**: Creating a goroutine is like asking someone to help - it takes almost no effort
2. **Execution is independent**: Once started, goroutines run on their own schedule
3. **Coordination is necessary**: You often need to wait for goroutines to finish or coordinate their work
4. **Order is not guaranteed**: Goroutines might complete in any order, regardless of when they started

### Connection to Other Concepts

- **Functions**: Goroutines execute functions, just concurrently instead of sequentially
- **Memory**: Goroutines share memory, which requires careful coordination (covered in later exercises)
- **Channels**: The preferred way to communicate between goroutines (next exercise)
- **Synchronization**: Tools like WaitGroup help coordinate multiple goroutines

## Your Task

### Part 1: Basic Implementation (Beginner)

Create a program that demonstrates basic goroutine creation and the importance of coordination.

**Requirements:**
- Create at least 3 goroutines that print different messages
- Each goroutine should include a small delay to simulate work
- Ensure all goroutines complete before the program exits
- Print messages from both main and goroutines to show concurrent execution

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Program creates multiple goroutines successfully
- [ ] All goroutines execute and print their messages
- [ ] Program doesn't exit before goroutines complete
- [ ] Output shows interleaved messages demonstrating concurrency

### Part 2: Enhanced Version (Intermediate)

Build a concurrent task processor that handles multiple workers performing different types of tasks.

**Additional Requirements:**
- Create goroutines that perform different types of simulated work (different durations)
- Use sync.WaitGroup for proper coordination
- Include task identification so you can track which goroutine completed which task
- Add timing information to measure concurrent vs sequential performance

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Multiple goroutines perform different tasks concurrently
- [ ] Proper use of sync.WaitGroup for coordination
- [ ] Task completion order is non-deterministic (varies between runs)
- [ ] Program measures and reports execution time

### Part 3: Production Ready (Advanced)

Create a robust concurrent task processor with error handling, graceful shutdown, and performance monitoring.

**Production Requirements:**
- Handle goroutine panics gracefully without crashing the program
- Include context for cancellation and timeout support
- Add proper error reporting from goroutines back to main
- Implement basic metrics collection (tasks completed, errors, duration)
- Use structured logging instead of simple print statements

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Graceful handling of goroutine errors and panics
- [ ] Context-based cancellation and timeout support
- [ ] Comprehensive error reporting and metrics
- [ ] Production-quality logging and observability
- [ ] Clean shutdown that waits for all goroutines

### Getting Started

```bash
# Create a new directory for your solution
mkdir goroutine-exercise
cd goroutine-exercise

# Initialize a Go module
go mod init goroutine-exercise

# Create your main file
touch main.go
```

### Starter Code Template

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

// TODO: Add any additional imports you need

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Starting goroutine exercise...")
    
    // TODO: Implement your solution here
    // Part 1: Create basic goroutines
    
    // TODO: Add coordination to ensure goroutines complete
    
    fmt.Println("Exercise completed!")
}

// TODO: Add helper functions for your goroutines
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Program Exits Before Goroutines Complete

**Problem**: The main function exits before goroutines have a chance to run, causing them to be terminated abruptly.

**Why It Happens**: The main goroutine doesn't wait for other goroutines to complete. When main returns, the entire program exits.

**Solution**:
```go
// Wrong - goroutine may not complete
func main() {
    go fmt.Println("This might not print!")
    // Program exits immediately
}

// Right - wait for goroutine to complete
func main() {
    done := make(chan bool)
    
    go func() {
        fmt.Println("This will definitely print!")
        done <- true
    }()
    
    <-done // Wait for goroutine to signal completion
}
```

**Prevention**: Always ensure proper coordination between main and goroutines using channels, WaitGroups, or other synchronization primitives.

### Mistake 2: Using time.Sleep() for Coordination

**Problem**: Using `time.Sleep()` to "wait for goroutines" is unreliable and leads to race conditions or unnecessarily long delays.

**Why It Happens**: Developers assume goroutines will complete within a fixed time period, but execution time varies by system load, hardware, and other factors.

**Wrong Approach**:
```go
func main() {
    go func() {
        // This might take longer than 100ms on a busy system
        heavyComputation()
        fmt.Println("Done!")
    }()
    
    time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond) // Unreliable!
    fmt.Println("Exiting...")
}
```

**Correct Solution**:
```go
func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(1)
    
    go func() {
        defer wg.Done()
        heavyComputation()
        fmt.Println("Done!")
    }()
    
    wg.Wait() // Waits exactly as long as needed
    fmt.Println("Exiting...")
}
```

**Prevention**: Always use proper synchronization primitives (WaitGroup, channels, context) instead of arbitrary time delays.

### Mistake 3: Race Conditions with Shared Variables

**Problem**: Multiple goroutines accessing and modifying the same variable without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable results.

**Why It Happens**: Goroutines run concurrently and can interleave their operations in unpredictable ways.

**Solution**:
```go
// Wrong - race condition
var counter int
for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    go func() {
        counter++ // Multiple goroutines modifying counter
    }()
}

// Right - use atomic operations or mutexes
import "sync/atomic"
var counter int64
for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    go func() {
        atomic.AddInt64(&counter, 1)
    }()
}
```

**Prevention**: Use atomic operations, mutexes, or channels to coordinate access to shared data. When in doubt, don't share memory - communicate via channels instead.

### Mistake 4: Goroutine Leaks

**Problem**: Creating goroutines that never terminate, leading to resource leaks and potential memory issues.

**Why It Happens**: Goroutines waiting on channels that never receive data, or infinite loops without exit conditions.

**Solution**:
```go
// Wrong - goroutine leaks if channel never receives
func leakyGoroutine() {
    ch := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        <-ch // Will wait forever if nothing sends to ch
        fmt.Println("This might never execute")
    }()
    // If we don't send to ch, the goroutine leaks
}

// Right - use context for cancellation
func wellBehavedGoroutine(ctx context.Context) {
    ch := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        select {
        case <-ch:
            fmt.Println("Received data")
        case <-ctx.Done():
            fmt.Println("Context cancelled, exiting")
            return
        }
    }()
}
```

**Prevention**: Always provide exit conditions for goroutines. Use context for cancellation, timeout channels, or done channels to signal when goroutines should terminate.

## Real-World Context

### Industry Applications

**Web Servers**: Handle thousands of concurrent HTTP requests, with each request processed in its own goroutine.

*Example*: A REST API server uses goroutines to handle multiple client requests simultaneously, allowing one slow database query to not block other requests.

**Data Processing**: Process large datasets by splitting work across multiple goroutines.

*Example*: A log processing system uses goroutines to parse different log files concurrently, significantly reducing total processing time.

**Microservices**: Enable services to handle multiple operations concurrently without blocking.

*Example*: A user service uses goroutines to simultaneously validate credentials, fetch user preferences, and log access attempts.

### When You'll Use This

- Building web servers or APIs that need to handle concurrent requests
- Processing data pipelines where tasks can be parallelized
- Implementing background workers that run alongside main application logic
- Creating responsive user interfaces that don't block on long-running operations
- Building distributed systems that need to coordinate multiple concurrent operations

### Production Considerations

- **Resource Management**: Monitor goroutine count to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error propagation from goroutines to main logic
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensure goroutines can be cancelled cleanly during application shutdown
- **Observability**: Add logging and metrics to monitor goroutine behavior in production
- **Testing**: Write tests that account for the non-deterministic nature of concurrent execution

## Extension Challenges

### Challenge 1: Concurrent File Processing (Intermediate)

Create a program that processes multiple files concurrently, with each file handled by a separate goroutine.

**Hints:**
- Use goroutines to read and process different files simultaneously
- Collect results from all goroutines before reporting final statistics
- Handle file I/O errors gracefully in each goroutine

### Challenge 2: Rate-Limited Task Processor (Advanced)

Build a task processor that can handle many tasks concurrently but limits the number of simultaneous goroutines.

**Hints:**
- Use a buffered channel to limit the number of concurrent goroutines
- Implement a worker pool pattern
- Add metrics to track throughput and processing times

### Challenge 3: Goroutine Orchestra (Expert)

Create a system where multiple goroutines need to coordinate their execution, like musicians in an orchestra.

**Hints:**
- Use multiple synchronization primitives (channels, WaitGroups, mutexes)
- Implement a conductor goroutine that coordinates others
- Add dynamic scaling - goroutines can be added or removed during execution

## Testing Your Solution

### Test Cases

```go
package main

import (
    "testing"
    "time"
)

func TestBasicGoroutines(t *testing.T) {
    // Test that goroutines are created and execute
    executed := make(chan bool, 3)
    
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        go func() {
            executed <- true
        }()
    }
    
    // Wait for all goroutines to signal execution
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        select {
        case <-executed:
            // Goroutine executed successfully
        case <-time.After(1 * time.Second):
            t.Fatal("Goroutine did not execute within timeout")
        }
    }
}

func TestConcurrentExecution(t *testing.T) {
    start := time.Now()
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    
    // Create goroutines that each sleep for 100ms
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
        }()
    }
    
    wg.Wait()
    elapsed := time.Since(start)
    
    // If running concurrently, should take ~100ms, not 500ms
    if elapsed > 200*time.Millisecond {
        t.Errorf("Execution took too long: %v (expected ~100ms)", elapsed)
    }
}
```

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Program compiles without errors
- [ ] All goroutines execute and complete their work
- [ ] Main function waits for goroutines to complete
- [ ] Output demonstrates concurrent execution (non-deterministic ordering)
- [ ] No goroutine leaks (program terminates cleanly)
- [ ] Proper error handling for any potential failures

### Performance Benchmarks

```go
func BenchmarkSequential(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < 10; j++ {
            time.Sleep(1 * time.Millisecond)
        }
    }
}

func BenchmarkConcurrent(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        var wg sync.WaitGroup
        for j := 0; j < 10; j++ {
            wg.Add(1)
            go func() {
                defer wg.Done()
                time.Sleep(1 * time.Millisecond)
            }()
        }
        wg.Wait()
    }
}
```

### Debugging Tips

**Goroutines not executing**: Check if main function exits too early. Add proper synchronization.

**Inconsistent output**: This is normal for concurrent programs! The order of execution is not guaranteed.

**Program hangs**: Look for goroutines waiting on channels that never receive data, or missing WaitGroup.Done() calls.

**Race conditions**: Use `go run -race your-program.go` to detect data races automatically.

### Explanation

The solutions demonstrate progressive complexity:

1. **Basic**: Simple goroutine creation with WaitGroup coordination
2. **Enhanced**: Task-based approach with timing and performance measurement
3. **Production**: Full error handling, context cancellation, metrics, and panic recovery

Key design decisions:
- Used WaitGroup for coordination (simple and effective)
- Implemented proper error handling and panic recovery
- Added context for cancellation and timeout support
- Included metrics collection for observability
- Used atomic operations for thread-safe counters

## Reflection Questions

1. How does the non-deterministic nature of goroutine execution affect how you design concurrent programs?
